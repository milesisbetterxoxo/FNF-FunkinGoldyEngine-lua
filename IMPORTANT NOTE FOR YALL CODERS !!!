use Psych Engine's library versions
works with Goldy Engine too of coursely lmfao

for visual studio settings, vs 2019 doesnt work anymore due to control flow guard.
use visual studio 2022, and use these settings:
MSVC v143 - VS 2022 C++ x64/86 build tools (latest)
Windows Universal C Runtime -- side note: i dont think this is required but just incase 
Windows SDK -- side note: any latest version available.
